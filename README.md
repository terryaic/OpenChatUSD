# OpenChatUSD
This project is aimed to build a dataset and tools for USD and Omniverse, this was inspired by the ChatUSD cloud api raised by NVIDIA.
currently, the dataset are mainly focused on coding for Omniverse platform, I just uploaded the first draft version which is still under reviewed. You can located it at dataset/draft. After I reviewed it, I would move it to release folder.
